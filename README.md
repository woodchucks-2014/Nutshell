Trello: [Nutshell](https://trello.com/b/WsmegpHC/nutshell)

Our app, nutshell, will allow a registered user to document their lives each day through a daily, albeit electronic, journal.

As a user I want to sign up, and then sign in to the web app.
As a user I want to submit unlimited amount of posts or "nuts" per day
Posts will be either text or images
As a user I want to be able to view all of my nutshells, separated by dates
As a user I want to see a list of other users and be able to see all of their nutshells, separated by dates
As a user I want to be able to only edit a nutshell during that day, but always be able to delete past nutshells
As a user I want to be able to comment on other user's nutshells anytime
As a user I want to be able to like other's nutshells
As a user I want to be able to log out
